<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah on March 28, 2003. I was an only child for a solid three and a half years, until my brother and sister were born. We lived in Utah for seven years until we moved to Albequrque, New Mexico. We only lived in New Mexico for a year and a half until we moved to Broomfield, Colorado. I first started to play soccer in fourth grade and I have played ever since. I will be an incoming sophomore at Legacy High School.</p>
